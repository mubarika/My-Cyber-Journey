# My Cyber Journey

I am starting my journey to learn cybersecurity. This is my public portfolio where I will track every project, lab, and skill I learn.

**My Goal:** To get a job as a Security Analyst.

**My 12-Week Plan:**
* **Phase 1:** Learn the foundations (Networking & Linux).
* **Phase 2:** Learn the core tools (Security+, TryHackMe, SIEM).
* **Phase 3:** Build my lab, finalize my resume, and start applying for jobs.
